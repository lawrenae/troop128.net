        <p>Camp Friedlander is the premier Boy Scout Summer Camp program with a wide variety of merit badge options,
            activities for younger and older Scouts, training opportunities for adult leaders, and some of the best
            camping facilities in the country. Each summer, thousands of Scouts from across the nation (and the world!)
            make Camp Friedlander their summer camp home for a fun week of learning, achievement, leadership, and
            Scouting at its best. &nbsp; Troop 128 has a long standing tradition of participating and leading at Summer
            Camp. &nbsp;In 2016 we will continue that tradition</p>

            is made. &nbsp;If you miss the April payment the cost of camp goes to $290. &nbsp; Please note that there

            <h3>How to pack</h3>

            <h4><u>METHOD FOR GEAR &nbsp;</u></h4>

            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Pack in Rubbermaid-type totes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">I am using a 25 gal tub but there have been bigger and smaller ones used.
                &nbsp;It makes a good headboard table too. &nbsp;Overflow, such a sleeping bag and pillow, can go in a
                sturdy duffle bag or double garbage bag (labeled with tape). &nbsp;We don&#39;t recommend a frame back
                pack - &nbsp;they don&#39;t pack well in the trailer, can get caught on things when unloading the
                trailer and get thrown under the cot in the tent (from there it can get smashed or kicked out of the
                tent completely, and you paid too much $ for that to happen). &nbsp;</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Put everything possible in the tub, except the bag chair, day pack and snack
                box. &nbsp;The chair and snack box will go into the trailer and he&#39;ll need his pack with him on
                Sunday.&nbsp;</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">I still pack by the day - all clothes for the day are together in a plastic
                grocery bag. &nbsp;Extras are in another bag. &nbsp;Sleeping clothes can be put in a separate bag.
                &nbsp;An alternate sleeping option is to pack bottoms and socks in a bag. &nbsp;Pull out the bag of
                clothes for the next day, get the shirt and wear it to sleep in with the sleeping bottoms. &nbsp;With
                this method, you always sleep in a clean shirt and you&#39;re half dressed when you wake up. &nbsp;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <div>
                <h4><u>METHOD FOR DAYPACK&nbsp;</u></h4>

                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">On Sunday(drop off day), your scout should have the following items in
                    his day pack. &nbsp;This will be inspected on Sunday!&nbsp;</div>

                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Full water bottle, sunscreen, swimsuit and towel (if you didn&rsquo;t
                    take swim test), substantial snack that wont melt in the heat, a hat, sunglasses,and his spending
                    money
                </div>

                <div style="margin-left: 40px;">Throughout the week, your scout should utilize the day pack to carry the
                    following items&nbsp;</div>

                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Water bottle,</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">supplies for various merit badge activities</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">sunscreen</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">pocketknife (with&nbsp;TotnChip)</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">Hat</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">sunglasses</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">money for the day</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">scout book&nbsp;</li>
                    <li style="margin-left: 40px;">A watch</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3><a id="Camp Policies" name="Camp Policies">CAMP POLICIES AND PROCEDURES &nbsp;</a></h3>

            <h4><strong>VISITORS AND LATE ARRIVALS&nbsp;</strong></h4>

            <p>Any campers (youth or adult) that will arrive at camp outside the normal check-in time must register at
                the camp office and get a camp ID bracelet. &nbsp;It is also important that any camper leaving the
                property sign-out at the office. &nbsp;In the event of an emergency, it is important that we know who is
                in camp at all times. &nbsp;Everyone in camp will be given a camp ID bracelet which must be worn at all
                times. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>All visitors must sign in and sign out at the Administration building and get a camp ID bracelet. &nbsp;Any
                visitor who has not registered may be asked to leave camp. &nbsp;It is important for safety that we know
                who is visiting our camp and when. &nbsp;Visitors who intend to eat a meal at camp can purchase a meal
                ticket at the camp office. &nbsp;Meal rates are as follows: &nbsp;Breakfast - $5.00; Lunch - $6.00;
                Dinner - $7.00. &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>INSURANCE&nbsp;</strong></h4>

            <p>Troops attending camp from the Dan Beard Council are provided secondary medical insurance coverage
                through registration and charter renewal. &nbsp;Out of council troops attending Camp Friedlander are
                required to show proof of accident insurance and a tour permit during check-in. &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>HEALTH AND SAFETY EMERGENCIES</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>Precautions for the safety of all Scouts and adults are paramount in the development of our programs and
                facilities. &nbsp;In the event medical needs arise while you are in camp, our health and first aid
                facilities are available with qualified personnel on duty 24 hours a day. &nbsp;Additionally, we have an
                agreement with Bethesda North Hospital, located seven miles from Camp Friedlander on Montgomery Road to
                handle any emergency that exceeds the capability of our trained medical staff. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>All emergency plans will be reviewed at the leader&rsquo;s meeting and posted at the Administration
                building, each campsite, and each program area. &nbsp;In the event of a camp emergency, it is essential
                that staff direction be followed to maintain order and safety. &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>MEDICAL FORMS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>Every Scout, adult, and visitor staying overnight is required to submit a &ldquo;BSA Annual Health and
                Medical Record&rdquo; with parts A, B, and C completed upon arrival to camp. &nbsp;A completed form
                includes a copy of the participant&rsquo;s medical insurance card. &nbsp;This form requires an annual
                update by a certified and licensed healthcare provider. &nbsp;This form must be updated and signed
                within 12 months of the date you will leave camp. &nbsp;Only submit copies of medical forms;<strong> do
                    not submit originals</strong>. &nbsp;Do not mail medical forms to the council office; bring them to
                camp. &nbsp;An electronic version of the form can be found in the <a href="#Forms">Forms</a> section of
                this site</p>

            <h4><strong>MEDICATIONS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>Camper meds and prescriptions will be handled the same way they are for campouts. The Troop Medication
                form should be filled out with detail about the meds, dosage and time and included with the meds in the
                original container, in a gallon Ziploc. &nbsp; The troop medication form is the second page of the
                permission slip. &nbsp;Please make another copy of your troop medication form and put it in the ziplock
                bag</p>

            <p>Since this is for a longer time period, an option that we have found successful for scouts with multiple
                medications is to include #1 - #6 and a brief pill description on the Troop Medication form. The
                medications may be put in a weekly pill minder, labeled with the scout&#39;s name and AM or PM to match
                the dosage time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Over-the-counter meds may be added to the Medications list and kept in the original container or put in a
                labeled smaller container or Ziploc bag for as-needed use. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>PUT ALL MEDS IN 1 GALLON ZIPLOCK with the Medication Form. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is a lot of paper work and detail, but this is for your child&#39;s safety in an
                emergency.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>ALL medications, prescription and non-prescription, brought to camp by Scouts and adults are &nbsp;REQUIRED
                to be secured in a locked storage. This policy may seem too strict for over-the-counter medications;
                however, if a camper consumes medication that is not meant for them, it has deadly potential. There will
                be certain exceptions for lifesaving medications to be carried at camp. Our health officers will make
                this decision during the medical record review. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>A designated troop leader should be named responsible for storing and distributing medications &nbsp;</p>

            <p>within the troop&rsquo;s campsite upon approval of the Health Officer. The camp can provide lockable
                storage and medication logs upon request. Medications requiring refrigeration will be stored at the
                Health Lodge. Medication must be in the original container and contain the following information:
                &nbsp;</p>

            <p>1)<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Camper&rsquo;s name and troop # &nbsp;
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) Prescription number &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5) Name of
                medication &nbsp;</p>

            <p>2)<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Name of prescribing physician &nbsp;
                &nbsp; &nbsp; 4) Date prescribed &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;6) Directions
                for use &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>CAMPSITE CHECK-IN/OUT</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>In an effort to minimize damage to Camp Friedlander&rsquo;s tents and equipment, we will continue to
                utilize the campsite check-in/out procedure. &nbsp;Unit leaders will be asked to thoroughly inspect each
                tent and indicate any damage found on a form provided by the troop guide. &nbsp;This form must be
                returned to the Commissioner on Sunday. &nbsp;When your troop checks out, the troop guide will inspect
                all tents. &nbsp;The troop will be charged for any damage found that was not indicated on the check-in
                inspection form. &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>EARLY RELEASE OF CAMPERS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>In order to release a camper prior to Saturday morning, an Early Release form for the Scout must be
                submitted upon arrival at camp. &nbsp;If this form is not on file in the camp office at the time of
                release, the Scoutmaster will be required to personally sign to release the Scout leaving camp. &nbsp;There
                are no exceptions to this policy. &nbsp;The Early Release Form can be found in the Forms section
                below.</p>

            <p>Picking your scout up from camp during the week is always kind of tricky. &nbsp;They can miss some of
                their merit badge sessions or evening activities. &nbsp;When they have an incomplete merit badge or
                missed an open area activity, it can be disappointing. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Early Release Form must be signed by a parent and our campmaster, Jim Hansbauer, before we turn them
                in at registration Sunday, 6/26. We will not have time to take care of this when we meet Sunday. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Use one form for each time you will be picking up your scout; the Camp Office files them by day. Please
                discuss these with your scout beforehand; a sturdy watch comes in handy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Parents must stop by the office and sign in, find your scout, go back by the office to sign him and
                yourself out. &nbsp;The office staff will pull the Early Release Form and the parent will complete the
                bottom portion of the form. &nbsp;When you return your scout, go to the office to sign you both in. Walk
                your scout back to the campsite or other prearranged location. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Please text or call Jim (513-307-9844) and confirm the pickup and return if you don&#39;t speak to him at
                the time. &nbsp;This sounds like a lot of trouble, but we have 40 scouts we like to keep track of.
                &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>MAIL AND TELEPHONE SERVICE</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>Mail and care packages are always encouraged at Camp Friedlander. &nbsp;Campers (and the Camp Director)
                love to receive a letter from home. &nbsp;Mail service takes about two days; please consider this when
                getting a letter prepared and include a return address in case it arrives after your troop leaves.
                &nbsp;The envelope should be addressed as follows: &nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Scout Name &ndash; Campsite and Troop # &nbsp;Camp Friedlander &nbsp;581 Ibold Rd. &nbsp;Loveland,
                OH &nbsp;45140 &nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Camp Director is partial to chocolate chip cookies and brownies! &nbsp;An occasional pie is also
                welcomed! &nbsp;</p>

            <p>There is an emergency telephone number at Camp Friedlander. &nbsp;The number is (513) 8318311. &nbsp;A
                staff member mans this phone during program hours. &nbsp;Only emergency calls are accepted for campers.
                &nbsp;There is a camper courtesy phone, located at the Administration building, which is accessible
                during office hours. &nbsp;Scouts are only permitted to use the phone when accompanied by an adult
                leader. &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>FIREARMS&nbsp;</strong></h4>

            <p>The camp owns and maintains its own shooting and archery equipment. &nbsp;Scouts and adults should not
                bring their personal firearms or shooting equipment from home. &nbsp;Participants with disabilities may
                be permitted to bring specialized personal shooting equipment, however, please contact the camp office
                prior to arrival to secure approval from the Shooting Sports Director and Camp Director. &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>SHOWER AND RESTROOM FACILTIES</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>Modern shower facilities are available throughout Camp Friedlander with separate areas for Scouts and
                adults. &nbsp;Adult facilities are private, unisex bathrooms, each with a shower, toilet, and sink.
                &nbsp;When available, go in and lock the door behind you, whether male or female. &nbsp;Wheelchair
                accessible facilities are available for both Scouts and adults upon request. &nbsp;Each shower house
                serves several campsites. &nbsp;Campsites should share in the daily upkeep and cleanliness of the
                facility. &nbsp;A cleaning assignment schedule will be shared with you at the beginning of the week.
                &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>DINING</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>Mealtime is often the favorite time of the day, as the entire camp comes together for good food,
                fellowship, and a break from the day. &nbsp;All meals are served in the dining hall and are served
                promptly after assembly on the parade field. &nbsp;Meals are served cafeteria style, and an alternative
                entr&eacute;e is available at lunch and dinner (cold cut sandwiches and peanut butter &amp; jelly).
                &nbsp;Lunch and dinner also include a well-stocked salad bar. &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>PARKING&nbsp;</strong></h4>

            <p>In accordance with BSA policy and safety regulations, personal vehicles (including golf carts) are not
                permitted in camp. &nbsp;Exceptions are made for adults with handicap needs &ndash; please contact the
                camp prior to arrival to secure a handicap pass that will allow you beyond the camp gates. &nbsp;The
                parking lot is clearly marked and just outside the entrance to camp. &nbsp;Only emergency and
                maintenance vehicles will be allowed to park at the Administration building. &nbsp;This policy is for
                the safety of all campers. &nbsp;We appreciate your cooperation in parking only in designated areas.
                &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>TROOP GEAR</strong></h4>

            <p>Updated for 2016 The ranger staff will haul your troop&rsquo;s trailer to your campsite upon your arrival
                at camp. &nbsp;For space considerations, please limit your unit to one trailer per campsite. &nbsp;The
                camp provides twowheeled carts that can be used to haul any troop or personal gear that is not in a
                trailer. &nbsp;There are no exceptions to this policy. &nbsp;Please be prepared accordingly. &nbsp;Carts
                are stored in the cart corral and must be returned when campers are done using them. &nbsp;Carts should
                not be kept in campsites for an extended period. &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>SMOKING AND ALCOHOL</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>Camp Friedlander is a tobacco-free facility. &nbsp;Smoking, vaping or tobacco use of any kind in front of
                any camper, adult, or staff member is strictly prohibited. &nbsp;The only designated tobacco use area in
                camp is inside your vehicle in the parking lot. &nbsp;Anyone who violates this policy may be asked to
                leave camp. &nbsp;Alcoholic beverages are never permitted on Boy Scout property. &nbsp;Please help the
                camp enforce these rules by making sure all leaders and parents in your troop are aware of this policy.
                &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>FOOTWEAR&nbsp;</strong></h4>

            <p>For the safety of all camp participants, open-toed shoes are not permitted to be worn around camp.
                &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>ELECTRONICS&nbsp;</strong></h4>

            <p>Updated for 2016 Scouts are not permitted to use personal electronics during programs, unless it is
                program related and approved by the Area Director. &nbsp;Scouts are only permitted to charge personal
                items in designated areas. &nbsp;Permitting the use of personal electronics by Scouts is always at the
                discretion of the unit leadership. &nbsp;</p>

            <h4><strong>SWIMMING CLASSIFICATIONS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>Updated for 2016 Every Scout will be asked to take a swim test in order to show his current swimming
                skill. &nbsp;While swim tests will be offered soon after arrival, your troop may find it convenient to
                perform swim tests prior to camp using the &ldquo;Swim Classification Record&rdquo; found online in the
                Forms section. &nbsp;Camp Friedlander will accept pre-camp swim classification tests conducted by
                qualified adults. &nbsp;The camp aquatics director reserves the right to retest all participants to
                assure that swim standards have been met. Qualified aquatics instructors include, but are not limited
                to:  Aquatics Instructor, BSA  BSA Lifeguard  BSA NCS Aquatics Supervisor  BSA Swimming &amp; Water
                Rescue  American Red Cross Water Safety Instructor  School Swim Coach &nbsp;</p>

            </ul>

            <h4><strong>Family Night</strong></h4>

            <p>Friday Night is Family Night &nbsp;</p>

            <p>All Scout parents and families are invited to take part in our Camp Friedlander family night to see and
                experience all of the fun and adventure that the Scouts have taken part in during their week at summer
                camp. All family members are invited to come out to camp and participate in our end of the week finale.
                &nbsp; Family night will begin at 5 p.m. on Friday night. &nbsp;Dinner will be served continuously from
                5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. at the Dining Hall. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Meal tickets are $7 each and should be reserved through the Troop prior to arrival to be submitted upon
                check-in. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Following dinner, camp will have open program areas. Scouts can guide families on a tour of the camp and
                show off their campsites. We recommend wearing good walking shoes. Open-toed shoes are not permitted in
                camp for safety reasons. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>A closing flag ceremony will be held at 8:45 p.m. followed by the closing campfire. All guests are
                invited to stay for the show. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Our Troop recommends skipping the dinner offered in the dining hall and making alternate plans with your
                scout before camp begins. &nbsp;Over the years families have enjoyed many different supper options:
                &nbsp;</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Your scout eats at camp @ 5:30, you eat at home and meet him @ the campsite (Terhar) at a
                    predetermined time (after he eats). &nbsp;You hang out and he shows you around. &nbsp;</li>
                <li>You meet your scout in the dining hall @ 5:30 with a dinner from the outside world (KFC, McD&#39;s,
                    pizza, his favorite homemade potato salad and bbq chicken). &nbsp;You hang out, he shows you around.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>You bring a picnic supper and meet him at Terhar and eat under our shelter. You may want to bring
                    your chairs. &nbsp;You can bring fishing poles and fish in the lake. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
            </ol>

            <p>You get the idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Whatever your plans are, discuss them with your scout before camp. &nbsp;If you say you will be there @
                6, BE THERE &nbsp;@ 6. By Friday everyone is tired and if mom and dad are 2 minutes late, the world
                comes to an end. &nbsp;</p>

            <h3><a id="Fun" name="Fun">FUN THINGS TO DO AT CAMP</a></h3>

            <p>Your scout will have lots to accomplish at Summer Camp. &nbsp;He will also have many extra programs
                available to him throughout the week. &nbsp;These programs are open to any scout. &nbsp; See below for
                more details</p>

            <p><strong>OPEN PROGRAMS&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p>Many program areas have some type of open program every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. &nbsp;This
                provides an opportunity for Scouts to simply do something with their buddy, or for a patrol or the
                entire troop to try an activity together. &nbsp;All activities are open on a first come-first served
                basis. &nbsp;</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>The following schedule is typical. &nbsp;Changes may occur, check back often! &nbsp;</p>

            <p><u>Daily Programs &nbsp;</u></p>

            <p>Always available: &nbsp;Basketball court, baseball diamond, horseshoes, gaga pits, and disc golf (discs
                may be borrowed from the Trading Post)&nbsp;</p>

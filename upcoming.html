        <p><b>Park Details</b></p>
        <p>Cumberland Gap is situated on the Kentucky-Virginia boundary approximately one-quarter mile north of the point where Kentucky, Virginia, and
            Tennessee meet. Indians used Cumberland Gap as a gateway through the mountains before the arrival of the white man. In 1750 Dr. Thomas Walker
            discover Cumberland Gap while searching for a settlement area. In 1775, Daniel Boone lead a group of about 30 men and cut out a road which led
            through the gap to the mouth of Otter Creek on the Kentucky River.</p>
        <p>Ewing trail starts at the Civic Park parking lot and climbs a steep 2.5 miles to White Rocks trail. White Rocks trail short very steep .5 mile trail
            that leads to the junction of Ridge Trail. Go straight to White Rocks campsite, go right to White Rocks overlook or go left to Sand Cave. The total
            ascent from the parking lot to the top to White Rocks overlook is 1,655 ' and takes about 2 hrs</p>
        <p>The 21 mile Ridge Trail follows along the ridge top of the Cumberland Mountains and leads from the west Pinnacle overlook to White Rocks overlook in
            the east end of the park. The trail has no visible blazes but does have some mile marker posts along the way. We found that the mile markers and the
            official map of the area did not match. The trail surface changes from dirt to rock to sand to pebbles and all combinations in between. It is a
            shared horse trail that is in good condition and is wide. There are many changes in elevation that make this a challenging trail.</p>
        <p>There are several features to see while hiking the trail, White Rocks is a large sandstone escarpment that overlooks Poor Valley Ridge. Sand Cave is
            a large 250 feet across rock house who's sand filled floor is like a east coast beach. A water fall flows over the rock house during wet periods.
            Martins Fork Cabin has a large stone fireplace, three wooden bunk beds, and a picnic table, and can be rented for $10.00 per night. Be prepared for
            mice! Hensley Settlement is a restored pioneer settlement (1903-1951) with cabins, farm buildings, schoolhouse, church, spring houses, wooden
            fences, and family graveyard. Skylight Cave is .4 off the trail and has an opening that lets light in from the top of the cave. We found Indiana
            brown bats and a small rodent which we could not identify. Pinnacle overlook has a lot of history and was the site of a civil war fort. The overlook
            sports vistas of Powell Valley, Fern Lake and the city of Middlesboro.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The positions that require a Leadership Council interview will take place the meeting before the election. This process will be similar to a
                scoutmaster conference however it will involve both the current youth president coupled with the lead advisor and committee chair. No parent

        </ol>
        <h3>Night of the Election</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The current crew president will only run the election for the future crew president after that the newly elected crew president will run the

                        advisor will consult and decide the winner.
                    </li>
                </ul>

    <div class="featurette" id="meeting">
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">SOP, on how youth conduct a meeting</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Going forward, Crew meetings will be held on the first and third Wednesday of the month. We will be following Roberts Rules of Order to conduct
                the meeting.
            </li>

            <li>Prior to the first meeting of the year and then again a week before the crew meeting the Crew President will touch base with the Crew Secretary
                to find out what the minutes for the prior meeting were and any old and new business that needs to be discussed at the meeting.
            </li>

            <li>The Crew President will touch base with the Lead Advisor and the Crew Committee Chairman to see what new and old business needs to be discussed
                at the meeting.
            </li>

            <li>The Crew President will then contact the other 4 Crew Officers and the Special Crew Officers to see if there is anything they need to speak
                about at the meeting. In the event that the Crew President does not hear back from someone, or if they have nothing to report on in the meeting
                he/she will list “nothing to report” on the agenda that office.
            </li>

            <li>The Crew President will then type out an Agenda (See attachment) and forward that to the Crew Advisor and the Crew Committee Chairman to
                approve. Once approved the agenda will be sent back to the Crew President who will then forward the Agenda to the Crew Secretary to send out to
                the entire crew. This email needs to be sent out to the crew no later than the Monday night before the crew meeting.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>At the Crew Meeting</p>
        <p>The Vice President of Administration will bring the meeting to order and lead the group in a flag ceremony. Once the opening ceremonies are complete
            the VP of Admin will turn the meeting over to the Crew President.</p>
        <p>Using the Agenda as a guide the Crew President will call on each of the Crew Officers, and Special Officers to go over their reports. If they have
            nothing to report, they will state “Nothing to report”. If they are not in attendance, the Crew President will read their report on their
            behalf.</p>
        <p>After the Officers reports are completed, the Crew President will go over our old business. At the completion of the old business report, the Crew
            President will ask the crew if there is any additional Old Business that was not discussed. Anything that is not old business will be deferred to
            New Business.</p>
        <p>After the Old Business report, the Crew President will go over our new business. At the completion of the new business report, the Crew President
            will ask the crew if there is any additional new business that was not discussed. Anything that is not new business will be tabled until later in
            the meeting.</p>
        <p>Once the old and new business is discussed then the Crew Business is discussed then the Crew President will lead the crew in a discussion of upcoming
            activities, events and anything else that needs to be discussed.</p>
        <p>The last order of the agenda will be to go around the room in a manner that the Crew President feels appropriate and give each crew member a chance
            to discuss anything that they would like to talk about.</p>
        <p>Once all matters have been discussed the Crew President will ask the Advisor and the Committee Chair if they have anything else we need to discuss
            before the meeting is brought to a close.</p>
        <p>The Crew Advisor will turn the meeting back over to the Crew President for any last minute comments or questions to the Crew.</p>
        <p>The Vice President of Admin will then close the meeting.</p>
        <p>After the meeting is adjourned the Crew Secretary will be responsible for organizing the minutes for the meeting so that the Crew President can start
            the process all over again.</p>
        <p>Notes:</p>
        <p>It is important that the Adults including the Advisor, Committee Chair and other adults in attendance try to remain quiet during the meeting. There
            will be time to talk once the Crew President has turned the meeting over to the Crew Advisor for the Adults to comment. Questions or comments by the
            adults should be held to a minimum unless the crew is asking someone a question.</p>

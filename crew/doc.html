                            the leadership of an adult (at least 21 years of age) tour leader, a youth member at least 16 years of age may be a driver, see
                            Venturing guidelines out lined in 3600.1. Passenger cars or station wagons may be used for transporting passengers, but passengers
                            should not ride on the rear deck of station wagons. Trucks may not be used for transporting passengers except in the cab. All
                            driving, except short trips, should be done in daylight. All vehicles must be covered by automobile liability insurance with limits
                            that meet or exceed requirements of the state in which the vehicle is licensed. It is recommended that coverage limits are at least
                            $50,000/$100,000/$50,000. Any vehicle designed to carry 10 or more passengers is required to have limits of
                            $100,000/$500,000/$100,000. Do not exceed the speed limit. Do not travel in convoy (see "Leadership Requirements for Trips and
                            Outings," No. 2 or section 3600.3). Driving time is limited to a maximum of 10 hours and must be interrupted by frequent rest, food,
                            and recreation stops. If there is only one driver, the driving time should be reduced and stops should be made more frequently. </p>

                            periodic checkpoint stops as a group. Plan a daily destination point. A common departure site and a daily destination point are a
                            must. If you cannot provide two adults for each vehicle, the minimum required is one adult and two or more youth members--never one
                            on one.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Code Of Conduct</h2>
        <p>All youth and adult participants are expected to abide by the Code of Conduct as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Venturing outline, oath and code along with the Outdoor code will be my guide throughout the activity.</li>
            <li>I will set a good example by keeping myself neatly dressed and presentable (The official uniform or activity uniform when specified by the
                Council, Unit leaders or activity leadership.)
            </li>
            <li>I will attend and participate as required in cooperation with other participants and leadership for the required activity.</li>
            <li>In consideration of the other participants, I agree to follow bedtime and sleep schedule of the activity, unless otherwise directed by the
                Council or activity leadership.
            </li>
            <li>I will be responsible for keeping my tent or quarters and personal gear labeled, clean, and neat. I will adhere to all Council and facility
                policies and regulations, including the Outdoor Code. I will do my share to prevent littering of Council - BSA and other facilities.
            </li>
            <li>It is clearly understood that the purchase, possession, or consumption of alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs by any Venturer is prohibited.
                This standard shall apply to all participants, both youth and adult.
            </li>
            <li>Serious and/or repetitive behavior violations by youth and/or adult participants including the use of tobacco, cheating, stealing, dishonesty,
                swearing, fighting and cursing may result in suspension or expulsion from the activity or serious disciplinary actions and loss of privileges.
            </li>
            <li>I agree that gambling of any form is prohibited.</li>
            <li>Possession or detonation of fireworks is prohibited.</li>
            <li>I will demonstrate respect for Troop, Crew and Council property and be personally responsible for cleanliness and any loss, breakage, or
                vandalism of property.
            </li>
            <li>Neither the activity leadership, nor the Council or BSA, will be responsible for loss, breakage or theft of personal items. I will label all my
                personal items and check items of value at the direction of troop (or Crew) leaders. Theft will be grounds for expulsion.
            </li>
            <li>While participating in Council activities, all Venturers, leaders and participants will obey the safety rules and instruction of all supervisor
                and staff members.
            </li>
            <li>No public display of affection is allowed. Sleeping areas are off limits at all times to members of the opposite sex.</li>
            <li>Adult leaders and youth are prohibited from having firearms and weapons in their possession in accordance with Council or BSA regulations and
                local, and state (and federal) laws.
            </li>
            <li>Adult leaders will be guided by the Guide to Safe Scouting, and obey all local, state and federal laws.</li>
            <li>Adult leaders must receive Youth Protection Training and follow the guideline therein.</li>

                activity.
            </li>
            <li>Serious or repeated violations of this code may result in suspension or expulsion at the participant's own expense from the activity or the
                Venturing Crew.
            </li>
            <li>I will abide by the Electronic Device Policy as outlined.</li>
            <li>I will not create or participate in private clubs, groupings or gangs within the CREW.</li>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Electronics, Internet & Email</h2>
        <h3>Technology Policy</h3>
        <h4>General guidelines</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Use the technology to build relationships with the troop, find useful information, communicate and share excitement about Scouting.</li>
            <li>Updates to social sites using appropriate, (non-­embarrassing), photos or clips can share and build excitement about Scouting.</li>
            <li>Don’t let technology detract from the outdoor experience, the program experience, or the Scouting experience for the troop or patrol.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Trustworthy</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A Scout is truthful with others online and is careful of the information shared.</li>
            <li>He does the right thing when sharing and makes sure to have permission to share the words or pictures of others.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Loyal</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A Scout uses his phone or device in a way that adds to his troop or patrol.</li>
            <li>A loyal Scout is careful to post only appropriate photos or clips and would never want to embarrass others with his updates or communication.
            </li>
            <li>A loyal Scout would not use a phone to exclude some Scouts from the conversation, for example with secret messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Helpful</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A Scout could use applications that can add to the outdoor experience, such as a star-map, first aid or GPS.</li>
            <li>A Scout should alert others to scams, cheats, and suspicious sites and point them to reliable sources of information. Encourage people to report
                bad online behavior.
            </li>
            <li>A Scout may use a phone to take appropriate photos of events or situations for the troop or for personal memories.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Friendly</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A Scout could use his phone to assist someone else with information or access to communication.</li>
            <li>A Scout could use his phone to invite others to join Scouting or to remind his fellow Scouts of important events and activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Courteous</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Ringers and alert messages should be muted — beeps, rings, and recorded music take away from the outdoor and Scout experience.</li>
            <li>A device should not be a distraction. Scouts should pay attention to the program and fellow Scouts. In a program or troop situation, a Scout
                should avoid checking his phone for incoming messages or emails, unless messages related to the program are expected. Consider using “airplane
                mode” and wait to check at designated free times.
            </li>
            <li>A courteous Scout does not interrupt a conversation with others to stop and check for inbound messages. The courteous Scout focuses his
                attention on his personal interactions, such as conversations in which he is engaged.
            </li>
            <li>A phone should not be used to insulate a Scout from the outdoors or others. For example, a Scout should not use headphones during a Scouting
                activity. During a Scout outing a phone should not be used for entertainment such as playing solo electronic games, idle web surfing, shopping,
                etc.
            </li>
            <li>A phone should not be used to play music or videos — for himself or for others — at an outdoor experience. Phone music at a campsite or campfire
                will take away from the outdoor experience for others.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Kind</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Not everyone can afford a smartphone. A Scout needs to be sensitive to others and avoid using his phone in a way that looks like boasting and
                makes other Scouts disappointed that they cannot afford such a device. This is no different from any other piece of gear.
            </li>
            <li>A Scout always treats people with respect while on social networks, playing games, talking, texting or in other digital activities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Obedient</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>When using digital devices, a Scout follows the rules and examples set by parents, guardians, teachers, and Scout leaders.</li>
            <li>A Scout abides by the rules on websites, services, devices and games.</li>
            <li>A Scout is aware that different settings, events or locations will have different rules for use of electronics.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cheerful</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A Scout uses games, messaging tools and social forums to build relationships with others while having fun.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Thrifty</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A Scout recognizes that his phone may run out of power, and learns to take measures to conserve power in his device such as by turning it off
                when not in use or by switching to “airplane mode” to conserve his battery.
            </li>
            <li>A Scout should not become overly reliant on his device. For example, a Scout should be ready with his map and compass rather than rely on his
                smartphone GPS.
            </li>
            <li>A Scout is a smart consumer. He knows his voice, text, and data plans and uses them wisely, careful not to run up charges on apps and sites.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Brave</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The Scout should not normally be calling home, or sending text messages back and forth with home. If the Scout thinks there is an urgent need to
                contact home, he should consult an adult leader first.
            </li>
            <li>Parents need to understand and agree that they are normally not to send messages or call their Scout while he is out with the program.
                Communication from home should be routed through an adult leader.
            </li>
            <li>Stand up for what is right. Do not participate in mocking or bullying others, even if others are doing it. Report suspected abuse to a trusted
                adult, like a parent or leader or call 911 as appropriate.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Clean</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A Scout uses clean language and only discusses appropriate topics when using digital devices to communicate with others.</li>
            <li>A Scout needs to take responsibility and take care of his device against damage from dirt, drops, water or other hazards. He may want to keep it
                carefully packed away against damage. He keeps his gear in good, working order.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reverent</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A Scout respects the feelings of other people and would never use digital devices to spread irreverent ideas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Mailing List Etiquette <a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en/articles/mailing-list-faq/etiquette.html">*</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Please include relevant text from the original message. Trim it to the minimum, but do not overdo it. It should still be possible for somebody
                who did not read the original message to understand what you are talking about. This is especially important for postings of the type "yes, I
                see this too", where the initial posting was dozens or hundreds of lines.
            </li>
            <li>Use some technique to identify which text came from the original message, and which text you add. A common convention is to prepend “> ” to the
                original message. Leaving white space after the “> ”and leaving empty lines between your text and the original text both make the result more
                readable.
            </li>
            <li>Please ensure that the attributions of the text you are quoting is correct. People can become offended if you attribute words to them that they
                themselves did not write.
            </li>
            <li>Please do not top post. By this, we mean that if you are replying to a message, please put your replies after the text that you copy in your
                reply.<br> A: Because it reverses the logical flow of conversation.<br> Q: Why is top posting frowned upon?

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">SOP, on how youth conduct a meeting</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Going forward, Crew meetings will be held on the first and third Wednesday of the month. We will be following Roberts Rules of Order to conduct
                the meeting.
            </li>

            <li>Prior to the first meeting of the year and then again a week before the crew meeting the Crew President will touch base with the Crew Secretary
                to find out what the minutes for the prior meeting were and any old and new business that needs to be discussed at the meeting.
            </li>

            <li>The Crew President will touch base with the Lead Advisor and the Crew Committee Chairman to see what new and old business needs to be discussed
                at the meeting.
            </li>

            <li>The Crew President will then contact the other 4 Crew Officers and the Special Crew Officers to see if there is anything they need to speak
                about at the meeting. In the event that the Crew President does not hear back from someone, or if they have nothing to report on in the meeting
                he/she will list “nothing to report” on the agenda that office.
            </li>

            <li>The Crew President will then type out an Agenda (See attachment) and forward that to the Crew Advisor and the Crew Committee Chairman to
                approve. Once approved the agenda will be sent back to the Crew President who will then forward the Agenda to the Crew Secretary to send out to
                the entire crew. This email needs to be sent out to the crew no later than the Monday night before the crew meeting.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>At the Crew Meeting</p>
        <p>The Vice President of Administration will bring the meeting to order and lead the group in a flag ceremony. Once the opening ceremonies are complete
            the VP of Admin will turn the meeting over to the Crew President.</p>
        <p>Using the Agenda as a guide the Crew President will call on each of the Crew Officers, and Special Officers to go over their reports. If they have
            nothing to report, they will state “Nothing to report”. If they are not in attendance, the Crew President will read their report on their
            behalf.</p>
        <p>After the Officers reports are completed, the Crew President will go over our old business. At the completion of the old business report, the Crew
            President will ask the crew if there is any additional Old Business that was not discussed. Anything that is not old business will be deferred to
            New Business.</p>
        <p>After the Old Business report, the Crew President will go over our new business. At the completion of the new business report, the Crew President
            will ask the crew if there is any additional new business that was not discussed. Anything that is not new business will be tabled until later in
            the meeting.</p>
        <p>Once the old and new business is discussed then the Crew Business is discussed then the Crew President will lead the crew in a discussion of upcoming
            activities, events and anything else that needs to be discussed.</p>
        <p>The last order of the agenda will be to go around the room in a manner that the Crew President feels appropriate and give each crew member a chance
            to discuss anything that they would like to talk about.</p>
        <p>Once all matters have been discussed the Crew President will ask the Advisor and the Committee Chair if they have anything else we need to discuss
            before the meeting is brought to a close.</p>
        <p>The Crew Advisor will turn the meeting back over to the Crew President for any last minute comments or questions to the Crew.</p>
        <p>The Vice President of Admin will then close the meeting.</p>
        <p>After the meeting is adjourned the Crew Secretary will be responsible for organizing the minutes for the meeting so that the Crew President can start
            the process all over again.</p>
        <p>Notes:</p>
        <p>It is important that the Adults including the Advisor, Committee Chair and other adults in attendance try to remain quiet during the meeting. There
            will be time to talk once the Crew President has turned the meeting over to the Crew Advisor for the Adults to comment. Questions or comments by the
            adults should be held to a minimum unless the crew is asking someone a question.</p>
